# Advance-Calculator-using-C-Programming
ABSTRACT
<br>
This project presents the design and implementation of an Advanced Calculator developed using the C programming language. The primary objective is to create a user-friendly and efficient tool capable of performing both basic and advanced mathematical operations through a console-based interface.
The calculator includes fundamental arithmetic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus, as well as advanced features like power calculation, square root, trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent), logarithmic functions (natural and base-10), exponentiation, absolute value, factorial computation, angle conversions (degrees to radians and vice versa), and quadratic equation solving.
The system is modular, making use of functions for each category of operations to improve maintainability and readability. Built-in error handling ensures correct and safe input from users, avoiding issues such as division by zero and invalid data types.
This project demonstrates practical knowledge of procedural programming, the use of standard libraries (especially math.h), and structured program design. It serves as a foundational step towards more complex software development projects.
